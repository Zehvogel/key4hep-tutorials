# Possible solutions for plotting exercise

This folder contains a python script and a ROOT macro that show how one could
solve the exercise. Note that they assume that you run them in the folder with
the input files as that is hard coded at the moment. They can be run simply via

```bash
python make_plots.py
```

or

```bash
root make_plots.C
```
